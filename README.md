    <h2>My Poems</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>The Bond Once Golden</h3>
      <blockquote>
Once, there was you and I,  
Two souls bound by a platonic tie.  
In your shadow, I found my light,  
Your laughter turned my wrongs to right.  
You were my shield, my quiet flame,  
The reason my heart beat without shame.  
A fortress in this world of pain,  
Through you, I found myself again.  
But now, like Dorothea, I’ve grown distant,  
Our bond, once vibrant, now resistant.  
New faces have filled my days,  
Yet I find myself lost in the maze.  
You once held my heart with gentle care,  
But then came the words I couldn’t bear.  
You struck a chord that left me hollow,  
A wound too deep for time to swallow.  
I long for the days when we were whole,  
When you were my anchor, my steady soul.  
But trust, once broken, is hard to restore,  
And I’m left standing outside the door.  
I dream of mending what’s been torn,  
Of friendships past, now weathered and worn.  
But fear grips me, keeps me away,  
For I can’t forget the hurt that day.  
So here I stand, a silent plea,  
Wishing you’d see the fractured me.  
Yet, the walls we’ve built keep us apart,  
Two broken pieces, one aching heart.  
If time could heal and words could mend,  
I’d give my all to be your friend again.  
But for now, I walk this road alone,  
Hoping one day we’ll find our way home.
      </blockquote>
