    <h2>The Bond Once Golden</h2>
    <div class="poem">
        Once, there was you and I,<br>
        Two souls bound by a platonic tie.<br>
        In your shadow, I found my light,<br>
        Your laughter turned my wrongs to right.<br><br>

        You were my shield, my quiet flame,<br>
        The reason my heart beat without shame.<br>
        A fortress in this world of pain,<br>
        Through you, I found myself again.<br><br>

        But now, like Dorothea, I’ve grown distant,<br>
        Our bond, once vibrant, now resistant.<br>
        New faces have filled my days,<br>
        Yet I find myself lost in the maze.<br><br>

        You once held my heart with gentle care,<br>
        But then came the words I couldn’t bear.<br>
        You struck a chord that left me hollow,<br>
        A wound too deep for time to swallow.<br><br>

        I long for the days when we were whole,<br>
        When you were my anchor, my steady soul.<br>
        But trust, once broken, is hard to restore,<br>
        And I’m left standing outside the door.<br><br>

        I dream of mending what’s been torn,<br>
        Of friendships past, now weathered and worn.<br>
        But fear grips me, keeps me away,<br>
        For I can’t forget the hurt that day.<br><br>

        So here I stand, a silent plea,<br>
        Wishing you’d see the fractured me.<br>
        Yet, the walls we’ve built keep us apart,<br>
        Two broken pieces, one aching heart.<br><br>

        If time could heal and words could mend,<br>
        I’d give my all to be your friend again.<br>
        But for now, I walk this road alone,<br>
        Hoping one day we’ll find our way home.
