    <h1>The Bond Once Golden</h1>
    <p>
      Once, there was you and I,<br/>
      Two souls bound by a platonic tie.<br/>
      In your shadow, I found my light,<br/>
      Your laughter turned my wrongs to right.<br/>
      You were my shield, my quiet flame,<br/>
      The reason my heart beat without shame.<br/>
      A fortress in this world of pain,<br/>
      Through you, I found myself again.<br/>
      But now, like Dorothea, I’ve grown distant,<br/>
      Our bond, once vibrant, now resistant.<br/>
      New faces have filled my days,<br/>
      Yet I find myself lost in the maze.<br/>
      You once held my heart with gentle care,<br/>
      But then came the words I couldn’t bear.<br/>
      You struck a chord that left me hollow,<br/>
      A wound too deep for time to swallow.<br/>
      I long for the days when we were whole,<br/>
      When you were my anchor, my steady soul.<br/>
      But trust, once broken, is hard to restore,<br/>
      And I’m left standing outside the door.<br/>
      I dream of mending what’s been torn,<br/>
      Of friendships past, now weathered and worn.<br/>
      But fear grips me, keeps me away,<br/>
      For I can’t forget the hurt that day.<br/>
      So here I stand, a silent plea,<br/>
      Wishing you’d see the fractured me.<br/>
      Yet, the walls we’ve built keep us apart,<br/>
      Two broken pieces, one aching heart.<br/>
      If time could heal and words could mend,<br/>
      I’d give my all to be your friend again.<br/>
      But for now, I walk this road alone,<br/>
      Hoping one day we’ll find our way home.
